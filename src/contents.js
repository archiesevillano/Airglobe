They think that was about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. Its diameter is about 8,000 miles. And Earth is the third-closest planet to the sun. Its average distance from the sun is about 93 million miles. Only Mercury and Venus are closer.",

Her porridge couldn't be too hot or too cold. And her bed couldn't be too hard or too soft. On Earth, everything is just right for life to exist. It's warm, but not too warm. And it has water, but not too much water.",

With GPS and other satellites, scientists can measure Earth's size and shape to within a centimeter. Pictures from space also show Earth is round like the moon.",
                        "Even though our planet is a sphere, it is not a perfect sphere. Because of the force caused when Earth rotates, the North and South Poles are slightly flat. Earth's rotation, wobbly motion and other forces are making the planet change shape very slowly, but it is still round."

                        "Through our relentless pursuit of progress and comfort, humanity has left a deep and lasting mark on our precious planet. Our actions, driven by short-term gains and indifference, have led to the deterioration of Earth's delicate ecosystems, the depletion of natural resources, and the alteration of our climate. The consequences of our choices are now undeniable: rising temperatures, extreme weather events, deforestation, pollution, and the loss of countless species. We stand at a critical juncture, where we must acknowledge the harm we have inflicted and take urgent action to restore and protect our planet. Together, we hold the power to reverse the damage, to heal the wounds we have caused, and to forge a sustainable future where humanity and nature can coexist harmoniously. Let us unite, with unwavering determination and collective responsibility, to preserve the beauty, resilience, and abundance of Earth for generations to come.",
